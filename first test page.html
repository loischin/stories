<h1> DETENTION SUSPENSION</h1>

<p> It was a beautiful day. The sun was shining,the birds were singing. However one thing didn't match the beautiul  day. 
"Dinah! Breakfast time!" Dinah sighed and got up. Dinah Bioly had been worrying for this day to come. It was her
 first day at Nether Street Primary! "OK" Dinah sighed as she got up to eat her breakfast. "Don't worry I'm sure
 you"ll be fine!" Her mother said trying to lighten Dinah's mood. Maisy Bioly was always trying to lighten everyone's mood.
 "Thanks Mom!" Dinah said as she finished off her jam toast and drank her milk. she leapt onto the school bus and arrived
 at Nether Street Primary. A kind girl called Charlotte Overbury took her in. However nothing prepared her for what was going to happen next...
 </p>
 
 <p> "Come on... What's your name?" Charlotte asked. "Dinah. Dinah Bioly." replied Dinah. "Well you're going to have so much fun here! 
 Did you know when anyone has a birthday Mrs Pila our headmistress brings out 10 bags of sweets for the whole school to share?! Well
 we have 366 kids in the school and we have birthdays every day in our school so when it's not a leap year sometimes we have double or triple or quadruple 
 or even octuple birthdays! Of course we have a couple of birthdays in December 31st plus additional 30 bags of sweets when we have Easter or Christmas!!!"
 ""Dddo  you have holidays?" Dinah asked nervously. She was of course taken aback at Charlotte's talkativeness and that tomorrow was the school holidays for 
 2 weeks so she'd only go to school for 1 day. " No. sorry. That's why we have loads of sweets." Charlotte said sadly. Dinah put her head in her hands. She was not going to enjoy this...
